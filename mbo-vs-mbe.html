<h2>Management By Objective(MBO)</h2>
<p>Peter F. Drucker proposed this concept. MBO is a process through which specific goals are set collaboratively for the organization as a whole and every unit and individual within it. Each individual's major area of responsibilities in term of expected of results are defined General Electric appears to be the first organization that implemented MBO. According to <strong>Peter Drucker</strong>: MBO is regarded as a system for improving performance, both of individual manager and enterprise as a whole by setting of goals at the corporate, departmental and individual manager's level. <strong>Robert Krether</strong>: MBO is a comprehensive management system based on measurable and
anticipatively set objective. <strong>Stephen P. Robbins</strong>: A program that encompasses specific goals anticipatively set for an explicit time period with feedback on goal purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Peter Ferdinand Drucker</strong></p>
<p>Organizations are purposeful goal-oriented groups of persons. Therefore, goals or objectives should provide the focus for every activity. Each job in the organization must be directed towards the objectives of the organizations as a whole and the contribution of every individual must be judged by the contribution made towards the accomplishment of these objects. This concept was introduced by Peter F. Drucker in 1954 in his popular book <strong>The Practice of Management</strong>. Need for MBO arises because it serves as a unifying force. It is necessary to unify the effors of difference individuals towards the achievment of organizational goals.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-principles-of-mbo">
<h3>Basic Principles of MBO</h3>
<p>Unity of management action is more likely to occur when there is <strong>pursuit of a common objective.</strong> The greater the focus on results on a time scale, the greater likelihood of achieving them. The greater the participation in setting meaningful work with accountable results, the greater the motivation for completing it. These call for:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Clarification of Organizational objectives</li>
<li>Specific Objectives for each member.</li>
<li>Participative Decision Making</li>
<li>Explicit time period</li>
<li>Performance Evaluation and feedback</li>
</ol>

<h3>MBO in Practice</h3>
<p>You'll find MBO programs in many business, health care, educational, government, and nonprofit organizations. Most organizations, in fact, make some use of MBO features because managers find that goals give people direction and it doesn't make sense to establish goals and then fail to evaluate whether or not they're being achieved.</p>
<p>MBO's popularity should not be construed to mean that it always works. There area number of documented cases in which MBO was implemented but failed to meet management's expectations. A close look at those cases, however, indicates that the problems rarely lie with MEO's basic components. Rather, the culprits tend to be factors such as unrealistic expectations regarding results, lack of commitment by top management, and an inability or unwillingness by management to allocate rewards based on goal accomplishment. Nevertheless, MBO provides managers with the vehicle for implementing goal-setting theory.</p>

<div class="section" id="management-by-exception">
<h2>Management By Exception</h2>
<p>Management by Exception is a &quot;policy by which management devotes its time to investigating only those situations in which actual results differ significantly from planned results”. In short management by exception means selectivity in work and priority in decisions known as employee involvement or participative decision making, encourages the involvement of stakeholders at all levels of an organization in the analysis of problems, development of strategies, and implementation of solutions.</p>
<p>Management by exception has been defined as a &quot;system of identification and communication that signals the manager when his attention is needed.&quot; Conversely, it remains silent when his attention is not required. The primary purpose of MBE is of course, to simplify the management process itself to permit manager to find the problems that need his action and to avoid dealing with those that are, better handled by his subordinates.</p>
