<h2>What is the main difference between System Software and Application Software?</h2>
<p>The main difference between System Software and Application Software is System Software are programs such as the operating system, that control the operation of a computer and its devices and that enable the computer to run application software whereas Application Software are those programs that enables users to perform specific tasks on a computer, such as writing a letter or playing a game.</p>
<p><strong>One characteristic in which most system software differs from application software is machine dependency.</strong> Application Software doesn't depend on the structure of the machine on which it works whereas System Software depends on the structure of the machine on which it is executed.</p>

<h2>Analogy</h2>
<p>When we see a movie, we see only the actors and the locations shot. But, is that all to movie making? You need the director to visualize the movie and guide the actors, the producers aranges for finance and other resources, while the cameraman plans and executes the shots, however, you do not get to see these people. It is much the same with software. The software that we see and work with is the application software. The software, like behind-the-scene people in the films, stays in the background, though they has very important work to do.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-is-it-difficult-to-seperate-system-software-and-application-software">
<h2>Why is it difficult to seperate System Software and Application Software?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In  practice,  the  difference  between  system  and  application  software  is  not  always  straightforward. Some programs, such as those used to burn DVDs, were originally viewed as utility programs. Today, these programs typically contain a variety of additional features such as the ability to organize and play music and other media files, transfer videos and digital photos to a computer, edit videos and photos, create DVD movies, copy CDs and DVDs,  and  create  slide  shows.  Consequently,  these  programs  now  fit  the  definition  of  application  programs  more  closely.</p>
<p>On  the  other  hand,  system  software  today  typically  contains  several  application  software  components.  For  example,  the  Microsoft Windowsoperating  system  includes  a  variety  of  application  programs  including  a  Web  browser,  a  calculator, a calendar program, a painting program, a media player, a movie making pro-gram, an instant messaging program, and a text editing program. A program’s classifica-tion  as  system  or  application  software  usually  depends  on  the  principal  function  of  the  program, and the distinction between the two categories is not always clear cut.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="system-software">
<h2>System Software</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>System Software consists of the operating system and utility programs that control a computer system and allow you to use your computer. These programs enable the computer to boot, to launch application programs, and to facilitate important jobs, such as transferring files from one storage medium to another, configuring your computer to work with the hardware connected to it, managing files on your hard drive, and protecting your computer system from unauthorized use.</p>
<p>System software consists of variety of programs that support the operation of a computer. Examples of system software are: Operating System, Compiler, Assembler, Macro Processor, Loader or Linker, Debugger, Text Editor, DBMS. These software’s make it possible for the user to focus on an application or other problem to be solved, without needing to know the details of how the machine works internally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Importance of System Software</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>With System Software we can interact directly with other parts of computer.</li>
<li>We can see images, open files easily using system software.</li>
<li>System software is interface between the hardware and user application.</li>
<li>System software help to operate hardware without knowing the complex hardware design.</li>
<li>Helps to understand the architecture of computer on which they run.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="application-software">
<h2>Application Software</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Application Software includes all the programs that allow you to perform specific tasks on your computer, such as writing a letter, preparing an invoice, viewing a Web page, listening to a music file, checking the inventory of a particular product, playing a game, preparing financial statements, designing a home, and so forth.</p>
<p>Application  software  is  software  designed  to  carry  out  a  specific  task.  Common  types  of  application  software  include  games,  Web  browsers,  word  processing  programs,  mul-timedia software, and more. Many application software programs today are commercial software programs that are developed and sold for a profit.</p>
<p>One  of the most widely used software suites is Microsoft Office. Although they are used for  different purposes, most application software programs share some of the same  concepts and  functions,  such  as  similar  document-handling  operations  and  help  features.    For  instance,  documents  are  commonly  opened, saved, printed, edited,  and  formatted  in  a  similar manner. Editing a document changes its content; formatting a document changes its  appearance  (such  as  by  changing  the  font  face, font  size,  or  font  style  of  text,  or  by   changing  the line spacing or margins. Commands can be issued via a variety of methods, such as by using menus, toolbars, keyboard shortcuts, or the Microsoft Office Ribbon—the  insertion point typically looks like a blinking vertical line and identifies the current position in a document. Online help is available in many programs</p>

<div class="section" id="system-software-and-machine-architecture">
<h2>System Software and Machine Architecture</h2>
<p><strong>One characteristic in which most system software differs from application software is machine dependency.</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="machine-dependent-features">
<h3>Machine Dependent Features</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Assembler translates mnemonic instructions into machine code. The instruction formats, addressing
modes etc., are of direct concern in assembler design.</p>
<p>Compilers must generate machine language code, taking into account such
hardware characteristics as the number and type of registers and the machine instructions
available.</p>
<p>Operating Systems are directly concerned with the management of nearly all of resources of a
computer system.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="machine-independent-features">
<h3>Machine Independent Features</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, there are some aspects of system software that do not directly depend upon the type
of computing system being supported. For example, the general design and logic of an assembler is
basically the same on most computers.</p>
<p>Some of the code optimization techniques used by compilers are independent of target machines.</p>
<p>Likewise, the process of linking together independently assembled subprograms doesn’t usually depend
on the computer being used.</p>
