<h2>What is the main difference between forward chaining and backward chaining?</h2>
<p>The main difference between forward chaining and backward chaining is Forward chaining starts with the available data and uses inference rules to extract more data (from an end user for example) until a goal is reached whereas Backward chaining (or backward reasoning) is an inference method that can be described as working backward from the goal(s). Forward Chaining starts with available data. Backward chaining starts with the list of goals.</p>

<h2>Forward Chaining</h2>
<p>Forward chaining starts with the available data and uses inference rules to extract more data (from an end user for example) until a goal is reached. An inference engine using forward chaining searches the inference rules until it finds one where the antecedent 5 (If clause) is known to be true. When found it can conclude, or infer, the consequent (Then clause), resulting in the addition of new information to its data. Inference engines will iterate through this process until a goal is reached.</p>

<div class="section" id="backward-chaining">
<h2>Backward Chaining</h2>
<p>Backward chaining (or backward reasoning) is an inference method that can be described as working backward from the goal(s). It is used in automated theorem provers, proof assistants and other artificial intelligence applications, but it has also been observed in primates. In game theory, its application to (simpler) sub-games in order to find a solution to the game is called backward induction. In chess, it is called retrograde analysis, and it is used to generate table bases for chess endgames for computer chess. Backward chaining is implemented in logic programming by SLD resolution. Both rules are based on the modus ponens inference rule. It is one of the two most commonly used methods of reasoning with inference rules and logical implications – the other is forward chaining. Backward chaining systems usually employ a depth-first search strategy, e.g. Prolog.</p>

<h2>Choosing Forward or Backward Chaining</h2>
<p><strong>When to choose Backward Chaining?</strong>
Choose Backward Chaining If you already know what you are looking for.</p>
<p><strong>When to choose Forward Chaining?</strong>
Choose Forward Chaining, If you don't necessarily know the final state of your solution.</p>

<h2>Forward Chaining example</h2>
<p>Suppose that the goal is to conclude the color of a pet named Fritz, given that he
croaks and eats flies, and that the rule base contains the following four rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>If X croaks and eats flies - Then X is a frog</li>
<li>If X chirps and sings - Then X is a canary</li>
<li>If X is a frog - Then X is green</li>
<li>If X is a canary - Then X is yellow</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This rule base would be searched and the first rule would be selected, because its antecedent (If
Fritz croaks and eats flies) matches our data. Now the consequents (Then X is a frog) is added to
the data. The rule base is again searched and this time the third rule is selected, because its
antecedent (If Fritz is a frog) matches our data that was just confirmed. Now the new consequent
(Then Fritz is green) is added to our data. Nothing more can be inferred from this information,
but we have now accomplished our goal of determining the color of Fritz.</p>

<div class="section" id="backward-chaining-example">
<h2>Backward Chaining example</h2>
<p>An Example of Backward Chaining:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>If X croaks and eats flies – Then X is a frog</li>
<li>If X chirps and sings – Then X is a canary</li>
<li>If X is a frog – Then X is green</li>
<li>If X is a canary – Then X is yellow</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This rule base would be searched and the third and fourth rules would be selected, because their
consequents (Then Fritz is green, Then Fritz is yellow) match the goal (to determine Fritz's
color). It is not yet known that Fritz is a frog, so both the antecedents (If Fritz is a frog, If Fritz is a canary) are added to the goal list. The rule base is again searched and this time the first two
rules are selected, because their consequents (Then X is a frog, Then X is a canary) match the
new goals that were just added to the list. The antecedent (If Fritz croaks and eats flies) is known
to be true and therefore it can be concluded that Fritz is a frog, and not a canary. The goal of
determining Fritz's color is now achieved (Fritz is green if he is a frog, and yellow if he is a
canary, but he is a frog since he croaks and eats flies; therefore, Fritz is green).</p>
