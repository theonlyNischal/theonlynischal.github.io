<h2>What is the main difference between RISC and CISC(RISC vs CISC)?</h2>
<p>The main difference between RISC and CISC is RISC processors have simple instructions taking about one clock cycle whereas CSIC processor has complex instructions that take up multiple clocks for execution.</p>
<p>One of the other major differences between RISC and CISC architectures is the set of instructions that can access memory. A related issue that affects both RISC and CISC architectures is the choice of which addressing modes the architecture supports. Architecture's addressing modes are the set of syntaxes and methods that instructions use to specify a memory address, either as the target address of a memory reference or as the address that a branch will jump to.</p>
<p>There are two basic types of processor design philosophies: reduced instruction set computer(RISC) and complex instruction set computers(CISC). In the 1970s and 1980s, processors predominantly followed the CISC designs. The current trend is to use the RISC philosophy.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="cisc">
<h2>CISC</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, CISC systems use complex instructions. What is a complex instruction? For example, adding two integers is considered to be a simple instruction. But, an instruction that copies an element from one array to another array and automatically updates both array subscripts is considered to be a complex instruction. RISC systems use only simple instructions. Furthermore RISC system assume that the required operands are in the processor's internal registers, not in the main memory.</p>
<p>A CISC design doesn't impose such restrictions. So What? It turns out that characterstics like simple instructions and restrictions like register-based operands not only simplify the processor design but also result in a processor that provides improved application performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="risc">
<h2>RISC</h2>
<p>RISC processor instruction set has a fixed length encoding of instructions and each instruction execute in a single clock cycle by hardwired implementation of each instruction. RISC architectures focus on reducing the number of instructions and working with simpler instruction sets having the limited number of addressing modes and allowing them to execute more instructions in the same amount of time. Program written for RISC architecture tend to take more space in memory but the RISC processor's increased clock rate allows it to execute its program in less time than a CISC processor takes to execute its program.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-amount-of-work-accomplished-per-instruction">
<h2>The amount of work accomplished per instruction</h2>
<p>The original CISC philosophy was to do as much work per instruction as possible. Doing more work with fewer instructions meant that writing programs (in assembly language) was easier, and it was easier to write code generators for compilers.</p>
<p>RISC designs, on the other hand, attempt to perform only one operation per instruction. For this reason, it often takes two or more RISC instructions to do the same work as a single CISC instruction. As a result, RISC programs generally execute between 1.5 and 2.5 times as many instructions to do the same work as an equivalent program running on a CISC processor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-size-of-an-individual-instruction">
<h2>The size of an individual instruction</h2>
<p>Most CISC designs use a variable instruction length, whereas RISC designs use fixed instruction lengths. Instructions on the 80x86, for example, range
in length from 1 byte to 15 bytes. PowerPC instructions, on the other hand,
are always 4 bytes long.</p>
<p>From a memory-usage point of view, CISC designs are more efficient
than RISC designs. A well-designed CISC instruction set can pack more
instructions into the same memory, thereby using less memory to hold the
same number of instructions. Combined with the fact that those (smaller)
instructions often do more work than individual RISC instructions, CISC
processors usually have a big advantage over RISC processors when it comes
to instruction density (that is, the number of instructions appearing in a
given block of memory).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-clock-speed-and-clock-cycles-per-instruction">
<h2>The clock speed and clock cycles per instruction</h2>
<p>So far, it appears that the CISC design philosophy is the outright winner
when comparing the two designs. CISC instructions do more work and, on
the average, require less memory to do that work. All other things being
equal, you might expect that programs running in a CISC processor would
run faster than equivalent programs running on a RISC processor.</p>
<p>In fact, this assumption turns out to be false. The implicit assumption
here is that all instructions take the same amount of time to execute, regard-
less of their size and complexity. In the real world, and especially for CISC
processors, complex instructions often take far longer to execute than
simpler instructions. Indeed, the holy grail of RISC design has always been
to reduce instruction execution time to one clock per instruction (CPI) or
less.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-number-of-registers-they-provide-and-the-way-they-use-those-registers">
<h2>The number of registers they provide, and the way they use those registers</h2>
<p>Most CPUs perform intermediate calculations in registers and use registers
to hold parameter and local variable values (to avoid accessing memory).
The more registers you have, the more data a CPU can manipulate without
accessing main memory. This is one area where RISC processors have a huge
advantage over CISC processors. A typical RISC CPU, like the PowerPC, pro-
vides 32 general-purpose registers, compared to the eight general-purpose
registers found on a 32-bit 80x86 CPU. 1 As a result, RISC CPUs do not have
to access memory anywhere near as often as the 80x86 CPU does. Because
register access is much faster than memor access, having these extra registers
helps RISC CPUs overcome the fact that many operations require the exe-
cution of two or more RISC instructions to do the same work as one CISC
instruction that can directly access memory</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="immediate-constant-operands">
<h2>Immediate (Constant) Operands</h2>
<p>RISC and CISC CPUs often vary considerably with respect to the type of
immediate operands that instructions allow. CISC CPUs support variable-
sized instructions that allow a program to specify 8-, 16-, 32-, and even 64-bit
constant operands as part of a single instruction. 2 RISC processors only allow
a single 32-bit instruction format and, therefore, cannot encode an instruc-
tion opcode, destination register operand, and a large immediate constant
into a single instruction. RISC CPUs, therefore, have to use two or more
instructions to load large constant values into a register. This situation worsens
as the instruction operands become larger (e.g., loading a 64-bit constant
into a 64-bit variant of the PowerPC).</p>
